## Windows Command Prompt Sprite-Based 2D Text Graphics Engine ##
I use the term 'graphics engine' very loosely here. This is just a pet project originally to emulate the game tetris
(included in the example).

The engine is sprite based, which means that everything drawn is either on the canvas (the background)
or on sprite objects (foreground). Everything that you can expect from a bare-bones 2D engine is here,
like collision, bounding, etc.

### Future work
I'd still like to work on this more, as much as I'm reinventing the wheel...I plan on adding:
- Colors!
- Audio!
- Non-smooth scrolling (not mario-esque)
- Areas or 'Maps'
- Physics
- 2.5D raytracing (Wolfenstein 3D-esque)
